# TOOL democounts.py: "Count Tokens" (Writes word per line, with decreasing token count. Finds token in first field.)
# INPUT tokens.tsv TYPE GENERIC
# OUTPUT counts.txt (Word per line, with decreasing token count)
# OUTPUT counts.tsv (Word per line, with decreasing token count)
# OUTPUT countsummary.txt (Summary information on token counts)
# OUTPUT OPTIONAL error.txt
# PARAMETER encoding TYPE [utf8: "UTF-8", latin1: "ISO-8859-1"] DEFAULT utf8

# Since Kielipankki Chipster failed to show a tokens.tsv as
# spreadsheet, with an exception instead, it's better to duplicate the
# result as both counts.txt and counts.tsv for the time being.

# Token counter to go with the simple tokenizer for the demo.

# On exception, save trace and re-raise.
