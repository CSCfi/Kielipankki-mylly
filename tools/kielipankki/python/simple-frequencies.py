# TOOL simple-frequencies.py: "Small Frequency Demo" 
# INPUT input TYPE GENERIC
# OUTPUT output

# Reads ./input (running UTF-8 text, reads maxlines + 1 lines)
# Writes ./output (frequencies of maximal "word-character" sequences)

# This script is a toy, useful for learning Chipster. This script
# could be parameterized for the number of tokens (including tied
# tokens or not), or a threshold frequency (to learn to allow
# parameters). - A family of scripts like this is sufficient to build
# workflows: tokenize like this OR use a better tokenizer OR parse to
# get best tokens with lemmas and maybe filter undesired tokens out,
# maybe select a column from parser output and THEN count frequencies
# with another script like this that reads tokens, one on each line.
# Maybe summarize frequency distribution (like, 5 or 11 order
# statistics). (Also, people will want character encoding guessers and
# mappers, with mind-reading ability. And sarcasm detectors.)
