# TOOL tsv-sample.py: "Random part of a relation"
# (Makes a random sample of the elements of a relation, aka a set of records.)
# INPUT one.tsv TYPE GENERIC
# OUTPUT sample.tsv
# PARAMETER size TYPE INTEGER FROM 0 DEFAULT 20

# This is not technically an operation of the relation algebra but
# this is technically an action of a random source on the algebra.
# Something rather like that anyway.
